Hi! My name is Martí Rubio, I'm a developer based in Barcelona! I studied Mathematics and Computer Science and I enjoyed every moment of it. I am currently working as an Operations Data Analyst.

This page is intended to contain my visualization projects, where I aim to create beautiful images from everyday data!
