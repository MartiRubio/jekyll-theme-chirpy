Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This third project that I will be explaining today comes from a passion that I have. Not long ago, when lockdown started I remembered how I liked to play chess as a kid, although I did not have any formal learning and I was not good at the game. Despite that in March I started playing again after probably 10 years without touching a chess piece. The games were not brilliant, but I started to get interested again for the game, up to the point where I wanted to create some type of visualization of a chess game. After playing around with Python this is what I came up with!

I tried to make it as concise but also as informative as possible! The main thing that we see in this poster is the big chess board in the middle with some colored lines. Then in the middle we have the name of the match as well as the players that participated in it and a little legend. Finally on the bottom we have the full match transcripted. Let me explain every part in detail! (If you like this design make sure to check my [Redbubble page](https://www.redbubble.com/people/MartiRubio/shop)!)

This game is one of the most famous chess games ever played, named the "Immortal game". As the title in the middle verses, it was played in Wijk aan Zee (the Netherlands) in 1999 by Kasparov (winner) and Topalov. It is recognised as one of the best games ever played because despite the multiple sacrifices made by Kasparov he ended up winning the game in a beautiful way. People that know about chess could talk hours about this game, I am only able to look at it and be really confused about why he gets to earn a victory with his moves. That's probably why he was world champion and I will never be ðŸ˜‚

Let's try to explain the big image in the center!

First of all, I think it is nice to know a bit how chess squares are named! It's really easy, each row gets assigned a number between `1` and `8` (starting from the bottom), and each column gets assigned a letter from `a` to `h` (starting from the left side). The end result is the following configuration.

We see that we have 2 main colors in the image: red and blue. The blue color corresponds to the white pieces and the red color matches the black pieces. We draw a line for every piece movement that we had in the game, so, for example, as the game started as `e4`, the first line that we would draw would be the following one. That is because the move `e4` means that the pawn that was located `e2` moves to `e4`, so we would draw a line between those two squares.

If we kept on drawing every line we would get the final image. Once I did that for the first time I realised that it was not that nice, because we ended up seeing a mess of moves, as you can see.

So what I did was assign to every move an intensity, so for starting moves the red and blue color would not have much intensity, and it was at the end of the match that we would see the lines more clearly, resulting in the image that we see here (and the one that it's shown in the poster).

Finally I just added the transcription of the match in case anybody would like to replay the match!

Here are some other formats that I did!

I also generated some other format for championships.

Finally I posted this posters in Reddit and had a warm reception. Look at the posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/kyiknr/chess_poster_design_i_made_following_the_moves_of/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualization/comments/lbwmk1/visualisation_of_the_21_matches_of_the_1972_world/)!

Before ending this post, if you liked any of this designs I made a [Redbubble page](https://www.redbubble.com/people/MartiRubio/shop) where I sell them in many formats (even in shower curtains, why not?). Make sure to check that out if you are interested, as it would help me a lot! You can also create your own designs in [this page](https://foreverchessgames.com) that I did with a colleague. ðŸ˜Š



See you! ðŸ‘‹
