Well, hello? 👋

If everything is working correctly this should be on the internet! I must admit that web developing is not my strong point, but you are not here for that I presume.  As you might have read in the [about]({% link tabs/about.md %}) page, my name is Martí Rubio and I'm a Mathematician and Comptuter Scientist based in Barcelona. 🏠

During the beggining of 2020 I finished my studies and started working full time. In those long office hours, I started thinking about creating cool images and visualizations about everyday data. My first goal was just to create some cool posters for my place, but given that some projects turned out better than I expected I decided to create a portfolio just to be able to share what I created! 🤓

This page will have (mainly) 2 types of posts:
1. Visualizations.
2. In-depth explanations about the visualizations aforementioned.

> I will try to keep all tags and categories updated, but I don't promise anything. 🤞

The main idea is to have lots of posts of **type 1**, but some projects don't end up working (like this one intended to create random Mondrian paintings). 🎨

And if some posts draw some attention (or if I just want to explain what I did) then I'll care to write a more in-depth explanation about the project!

So that's pretty much what I have to explain about this page! If you have any doubt you can contact me through the links you can find at the bottom left of the page! 📬

See you!
