I like colors. You will see. Most of my posts will use color in some way or another. This first one is no exception! For the last two weeks I've been working in my first big project and now I'm ready to show it.

What you are seeing are the billboards for the top <a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250" target="_blank">250 movies from IMDb</a>. This poster shows every movie from that ranking as well as the color palette for that image.

> The image quality that you are seeing has been reduced drastically for performance issues, the original one uses 20MB!

In some detail:

As you can see, I have created the palette making sure that the proportions between the colors corresponds to the proportion shown in the original poster! And always showing 5 colors.

> A palette with less colors was boring and with more colors I feel like it shows too much information!

This project was mainly done in Python and once the image with the 250 posters was generated the titles were added with Photoshop. If you want to read a more in-depth explanation about how I did it you can find it [here]({% link _posts/2020-09-13-in_depth_movies.md %})! The main motivation for this project was to make a cool poster that I could frame and hang in my room and, given that I did that, I'll count this as a major success! ðŸ¥³ 

If you would like this image printed do not doubt to reach me via mail or Twitter (found in the bottom of the left menu!).

See you! ðŸ‘‹
