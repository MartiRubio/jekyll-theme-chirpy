Hi! ðŸ‘‹

In my last project (found [here]({% link _posts/2020-09-13-movies.md %})) I created an image containing the top 250 movies rated by IMDb as well as the image color palette. I really liked the final result and I wanted to experiment with even more images but also I wanted to have a dedicated API for those. The answer was Spotify! Here's the result!

The first question that one might have with this post is: what albums did you choose? The answer to that is a book that has the same title as the poster: _1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die_. I've had this book for years and when I did the IMDb project I kept thinking about this book and all the album covers that it contains, but I didn't want to manually write and download all items. Luckily for me I found out that somebody else had parsed all the album titles and so I decided to start the project.

Using Spotify's API was really easy and I will discuss the details in the in-depth post (WIP), but the best thing was that (almost) every image had the same format: `640x640`, so no resizing! ðŸ¥³

Once I had all images the code was pretty much the same as last time, but this time I decided to make every color in the palette the same size. This was done because as I had more images, it meant that each image (and each palette) would be smaller, so I wanted the colors to be easily percieved. ðŸ‘€

Finally I had to define a way to arrange the 1001 images, because the "obvious" way would be to do `13x77`, but that proportion would be too stretched (below the possible result ðŸ‘‡).

I decided that `20x49` and adding the final 21 as an extra row was a good enough format. The other option that I had was to just "forget" an album and create a `25*40` image... ðŸ™„ Anyway, once I had the final image I added a title with Photoshop and prepared it to print (I don't quite like the font now...). I will say that this project has also been a success as I have this poster now framed in my room! ðŸŽ‰

As I said before, if you would like this image printed do not doubt to reach me via mail or Twitter (found in the bottom of the left menu!).

See you! ðŸ‘‹
